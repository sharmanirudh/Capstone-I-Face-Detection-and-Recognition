### Tools & Technologies:
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
- [PWA (Progressive Web App)](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) - web applications that load like regular web pages or websites but can offer the user functionality such as working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access traditionally available only to native applications.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.
- [Django](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - backend framework.
- [PyBuilder](http://pybuilder.github.io/) - build tool.
- [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) - test tool.
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - a free and open source symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.

### Docker
It is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.
